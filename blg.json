Time to go out of service. SO tor can fuck me up, if the police of this area is really good then there's a chance I can get fucked up. Yet neighbours wife, so I don't think there should be an issue. got a puzzle to crack ws fun, match domain and match w that. another puzzle. This is very dangerous just be chills ",

    "Text": "First question valid anagram. \r\n\r\nSo general approach in regards to each problem will be, solve on paper then explain the logic here in this and pu u pu, next question !!\r\n\r\nValid Anagram: \r\nBrute Force approach, so we will sort both the strings and check letter by letter. Moroever incase the length is not matching it automatically is not. And since our return is a bool type so ig the algo should be like : \r\n\r\nSTART ->Size Match-> SORT -> Loop(Condition)-> return false, loop executed successfully return true \r\n\r\nIn practice the code looks like \r\n'''\r\n        sort(s.begin(),s.end());\r\n        sort(t.begin(),t.end());\r\n        if(s.size()!=t.size())\r\n        return false;\r\n\r\n        for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++){\r\n            if(s[i]!=t[i])\r\n            return false; \r\n        }\r\n        return true;\r\n'''\r\nThis is brute approach, how about now, I fw it since time complexity was not v good. \r\nIf I'm sorting let's try with juct checking strings if they match instead of each char.\r\n\r\n'''\r\nsort(s.begin(),s.end());\r\n        sort(t.begin(),t.end());\r\n        if(s.size()!=t.size())\r\n        return false;\r\n        if(s!=t)\r\n            return false; \r\n        \r\n        return true;\r\n'''\r\nThis also works, but just doesn't satisfies me. Feels like smth is missing, ig back to pen nd paper for hash. For hash I don't think we need to actually sort, since it's taking in all the chars. nd then condition \r\n\r\nSo hash map algo should be \r\nStart-> <char,int> hash -> Entry -> Remove entry nd anywhere the char : int is 0 false. Very vague I peeped into solution. 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️\r\n\r\n'''\r\n if (s.size() != t.size()) return false;\r\n        unordered_map<char, int> map;\r\n        for (char c : s) {\r\n            map[c]++;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        for (char c : t) {\r\n            if (map.find(c) == map.end() || map[c] == 0) return false;\r\n            map[c]--;\r\n        }\r\n        return true;\r\n'''\r\nNext question \r\nGroup of Anagrams, I feel so distracted as I sit, like everything is calling me. let's work about this probem. \r\nSo we group the alike anagrams, so we can just sort each string, and w it we add the orginal str. like <string, vector<string>>\r\nAlgo would be: \r\nStart-> check of sorts nd add org-> extract the vectors nd add to a 2-d vec. \r\nsimple right, maybe solution was right there when I opened the link. \r\nThe code which I wrote rn... \r\n'''\r\n unordered_map<string,vector<string>> um;\r\n        for(string p: strs){\r\n            string s = p;\r\n            sort(s.begin(),s.end());\r\n            um[s].push_back(p);\r\n        }\r\n        vector<vector<string>> r;\r\n        for(auto [key,pair]: um){\r\n            r.push_back(pair);\r\n        }\r\n        return r;\r\n'''\r\nI feel like there should be a timer as well on this page yk just for BC, like I should track how much time I give to my works right. \r\nSo for blog two things has popped, category of blog nd timer. Category will take time because I need to write more to understand how to categorise them. \r\n\r\nNext question I feel fresh, I can go about it, fuck commercial music shit is addictive. Like porn to ears which in releases dopamine nd when the spike is done. We have brain fog. Ig recognising patterns is good, IDK, how can I be so sure about myself, but recognising patterns is neccessary based of the situation one maybe at. \r\n\r\nENCODE AND DECODE: \r\nThis problem is blocked because leetcode subscription, but fuck dis. I got neetcode. \r\nFuck neet code !! Input: \r\n[\"neet\",\"code\",\"love\",\"you\"]\r\n\r\nOutput:[\"neet\",\"code\",\"love\",\"you\"]\r\n\r\nTF is tgis. Like take in the input nd produce the same output is that the goal. I don't guess so. Ig I'll use geek code for better understanding. in neet code. \r\nclass Solution {\r\npublic:\r\n    string encode(vector<string>& strs) {}\r\n    vector<string> decode(string s) {}\r\n};\r\nSo two functions, Like I lose the motivation to code, like I start to feel lazy. ig this question is to be solved from python and not c++. Clear choice. \r\nSo I will solve 3 questions in my night attempt. At 9'oclock Ig works!! \r\nThen wht is next now ..? cons. \r\nOn render I cannot save data wtf !! \r\nig I will need to get a domain. \r\n",
